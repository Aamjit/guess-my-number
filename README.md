# guess-my-number

    This is a simple game of guessing a number between 1 to 20 and finding out if you could guess it right.

---:smiley: how the game works :smiley:---

The game will generate a random number ranging from 1 to 20

You will have to guess the number provided in the input field.

If you can guess it right it will display a message and the number it generated.

if your guess is higher than the number it will display a message saying
> üìà Too high!

Similarly, if your guess is lower than the number it will display a message saying
> üìâ Too low!

And if there is no input or 0, it will display a message saying
> ‚õîÔ∏è No number!

Your score always starts from 20 for each round of the game.
For each wrong guess, your score will decrease by 1
When it reaches 0, you will lose the game.

So, Have fun playing.:sweat_smile::sweat_smile:
